----- UNSAFE CODE -----
For this part of code, "handler" program cannot force a program to stop for saving a program state.
As WINAPI might or might not be random when it comes to HANDLEs and cannot be sure if it's okay to stop the code while using WINAPI or kernel calls.
Libraries function address or variables might change whenever a code changes, as they will be "in always updated".
